# Distribution Modules

+ Code that is generic to install a shared component should belong iin
the `dist` directory. 
+ Manifests in this directory can cross-reference other Manifests in the
distribution directory, but they cannot depend on site manifests. 
These Manifests should be edited as infrequently as possible

!SLIDE

# Site Modules

+ Code that is site-specific to an organization should belong in the
`site` directory. 
+ Manifests in this directory can depend on `dist` Manifests or other siteâ€™
manifests.

+ Creating complex resource relationships.
  - Definitions are purposely limited
+ When you need more complex control of the interaction with the OS
  - Custom Definitions
